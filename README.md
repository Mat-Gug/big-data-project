# Big Data: Wikipedia Analysis :page_facing_up::bar_chart:

Hello everyone, thank you for being here! ðŸ˜Š

This project consists of 2 different Databricks notebooks:
1. In the first notebook, titled `Wikipedia Analysis - EDA`, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) activity has been carried out to analyze and statistically assess the informative content of the dataset. Specifically, using **SparkSQL**, the following quantities have been calculated *for each category*:
     * Number of articles.
     * Average number of words in an article.
     * Number of words in the longest article.
     * Number of words in the shortest article.

    In addition, the most representative word cloud has been identified for each category. Let's start!  
2. `dd`

aims to utilize SparkSQL and PySpark in Databricks for Exploratory Data Analysis and Article Classification of Wikipedia articles.
